# VideoWatcher
## Watch home videos easily: an iOS Swift open-source project

VideoWatcher is an iOS app (designed for iPad) that will randomly play video files from any specified local folder.  Intended as a way to enjoy large libraries of home videos. Users with 1000+ videos will never likely play them all through.  This app will let users enjoy their videos, several at a time.  By clicking on any video, it jumps to another, randomly-selected video.  You will also be able to identify "favorite" moments to play in a playlist.  And ultimately, share with others. 

Like being a TV producer for your own life.

Next steps:
* Allow "favoriting" of videos: build a favorites playlist
* Enable annotation of videos: title, date created, notes, etc.
* For longer videos (> 30 secs), start at a random point in the video (rather than always play from the beginning)
